# Clock Button v1.2

Clock Button is an extension for Safari that adds a live analog clock to the toolbar.

It includes an option to show the current time in digital format as a badge on the toolbar button, with support for both 24- and 12-hour notation.

Itâ€™s especially useful when Safari is in fullscreen mode and the system clock in the menu bar is hidden.
